# UAudio Audio Showcase

UAudio Audio Showcase is a little project of mine that I spend most of my freetime on. Currently it has 2 backends, XAudio2 and WasAPI and it uses ImGui for its UI.
Audio data and effects are fully done by me and this is mostly meant as a project for researching how audio data works. It also uses UAudio Wave Reader, another project of mine.
